Hoyt's Scripts For Realm

This is a compiled group of mostly old scripts by other people.

I do not own any of the scripts not listed in comments as belonging to me.

I only made this so that the people who play realm will have better access to some tools that I find make this game much more enjoyable.

I in no way wish to promote hacking this game, I only provide scripts to enhance the game.

For the full list of scripts and hotkeys open Changelog.txt

To use this script

1. Extract the content to a folder of your choice.

2. Install [Autohotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) for Windows or [IronAHK](http://www.ironahk.net/)
  for OSX or Linux
  
3. Start up Realm of the Mad God

4. Enjoy.
